# Drumkid 2
Aleatoric drum machine, uses random numbers to generate/alter drumbeats. This project is the successor to the original Drumkid, which was released in 2020. Drumkid 2 runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico. This repo contains both code for the Pico and PCB files.

## Pico setup
I used the official Raspberry Pi Pico installer for Windows to set up the Pico toolchain for Visual Studio Code. You may need to copy the .vscode files from https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup-windows/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#creating-a-new-project to use the correct kit.
