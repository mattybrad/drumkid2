# Drumkid 2
Aleatoric drum machine, uses random numbers to generate/alter drumbeats. This project is the successor to the original Drumkid, which was released in 2020.

Drumkid 2 will use a Raspberry Pi Pico with a DAC for high-quality audio (as opposed to the Arduino clone with lo-fi PWM audio in Drumkid 1). Aiming to keep most of the core features from DK1, but adding CV/sync functionality. Likely to release both a standalone (metal case) and Eurorack module version, both of which will probably be available as kits at some point. More details to come.
