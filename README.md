# Drumkid 2
Aleatoric drum machine, uses random numbers to generate/alter drumbeats. This project is the successor to the original Drumkid, which was released in 2020. Drumkid 2 runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico. This repo contains both code for the Pico and PCB files.

## Setup
I used the official Raspberry Pi Pico installer for Windows to set up the Pico toolchain for Visual Studio Code. Remember to update the repo's submodules. The SD card code submodule is a specific commit (v1.1.2), not the latest version. Have included the .vscode folder, which may be different on non-Windows systems?
