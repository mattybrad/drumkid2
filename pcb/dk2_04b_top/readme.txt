DK Eurorack prototype

Either single PCB or double-decker
	PCB 1 = user interface, display, shift reg's, muxes, SD slot
	PCB 2 = pico, power, DAC, maybe op-amps?
	Think we can just about get away with single PCB
PCB dimensions 120 wide x 108 high (now 140 x 108, increased from 24HP to 28HP)
16 buttons (2 shift reg's)
12 pots (2 muxes inc CV's)
5 trigger outputs?
1 trigger input
4 analog CV inputs
2 audio outputs
SD card, vertical? Yamaichi PJS008U-3000-0?
	Just using SPI not SDIO, doesn't need to be very fast(?)
Power, buck converter, more efficient
Display: TBC
