TODO:
- Tidy up groups feature
- First DAC cycle after start button press is v slow (10ms+, should be 5ms max), no idea why
- Chance maybe not totally stable, hard to lock at 4095, especially when including CV (bigger top deadzone?)
- Relaxed pass through the code to add comments while still fresh in head
- Create 8 preset kits
- Write manual copy
- Record demo video
- When to save settings in external clock mode if no start/stop?!
- Pulse light sometimes gets stuck
- Setting for whether to interpolate hits in ext mode
- Check zoom at 50% is steady sensible value (quarter note?)
- PPQN must be 1 for internal clock mode
- Live edit is probably broken since changing timing stuff

FUTURE STUFF:
- Tapping should be allowed to start on beat other than first beat
- Somehow avoid double hits when doing tap tempo (similar to live edit..?)
- Pressing "X" after selecting beat/tempo/tuplet etc should revert to previous setting for that param (niche but logical)
- Try incrementing settings writes onto next page, not next sector
- Try Pico 2, should be better
- Swing zoom cutout is optional in settings
- Scrolling text for longer settings labels
- Seed the rand function
- More beats, plus empty ones for users
- Soft reset?
- Extra protection ("no") for factory reset
- Move some stuff to second core, maybe events, maybe hit calculation
- Dotted notes in tuplet mode?
- Manual save vs auto save, setting
- Backup to SD
