TODO:
- Step doesn't keep incrementing in ext sync mode when stopped
- Tidy up groups feature
- First DAC cycle after start button press is v slow (10ms+, should be 5ms max), no idea why
- External clock mode needs attention, especially switching from internal mode to external
- Crashes on beat 16 (fair enough, doesn't exist)
- Reset nextHitStep or whatever when beat starts
- Factory reset doesn't wipe saved beat(s?), at least the currently used one. Actually factory reset doesn't seem to reset very much at all! CHECK IT
- Possible missed hits...? Check chance deadzone
- Chance maybe not totally stable, hard to lock at 4095, especially when including CV (bigger top deadzone?)
- Relaxed pass through the code to add comments while still fresh in head
- Create 8 preset kits
- Write manual copy
- Record demo video

FUTURE STUFF:
- Pressing "X" after selecting beat/tempo/tuplet etc should revert to previous setting for that param (niche but logical)
- Try incrementing settings writes onto next page, not next sector
- Try Pico 2, should be better
- Swing zoom cutout is optional in settings
- Scrolling text for longer settings labels
- Seed the rand function
- More beats, plus empty ones for users
- Soft reset?
- Extra protection ("no") for factory reset
- Move some stuff to second core, maybe events, maybe hit calculation
- Dotted notes in tuplet mode?
- Manual save vs auto save, setting
- Backup to SD
