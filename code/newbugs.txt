TODO:
- Rewrite LED/GPIO pulse system, which currently runs out of alarms when there are a lot of notes
- Make error text flash
- Magnet
- Cluster
- Swing
- Zoom cutout setting in swing mode
- Step doesn't keep incrementing in ext sync mode when stopped
- Turn off random hits in edit modes
- Live edit different display
- Drop rand
- Drop all
- Tap tempo should average several taps
- Tap tempo / external tempo display should use floats and display a decimal point
- Debounce button pushes
- Tidy up groups feature
- Figure out behaviour if desired output pulse length is too long for PPQN value at given tempo
- First DAC cycle after start button press is v slow (10ms+, should be 5ms max), no idea why
- DisplayPulse is scheduled, which means it can override other display functions - needs to be cancellable
- Double hits in live edit mode (direct hit followed by scheduled hit) (MAYBE FIXED?)
- Chance centre deadzone similar to pitch
- Create 16+ preset beats (more later)
- Create 8 preset kits
- Check CV inputs
- Check settings save works properly
- Function to generate basic samples without SD (sine waves, noise, etc)
- Figure out first bootup behaviour (clear/init flash, loading samples, etc)
- Factory reset mode
- Write manual headings
- Write manual copy
- Record demo video

STUFF SINCE BURNDOWN LIST:
- External clock mode needs attention, especially switching from internal mode to external
- Crashes on beat 16 (fair enough, doesn't exist)
- Reset nextHitStep or whatever when beat starts
- Factory reset doesn't wipe saved beat(s?), at least the currently used one...
- Possible missed hits...? Check chance deadzone
- Chance maybe not totally stable, hard to lock at 4095, especially when including CV (bigger top deadzone?)
- Relaxed pass through the code to add comments while still fresh in head

FUTURE STUFF:
- Swing zoom cutout is optional in settings
- Scrolling text for longer settings labels
- Seed the rand function
- More beats, plus empty ones for users
- Soft reset?
- Extra protection ("no") for factory reset
- Move some stuff to second core, maybe events, maybe hit calculation
- Dotted notes in tuplet mode?
