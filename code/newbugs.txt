Bugs for the refactored code Aug 2024:

- Beat takes a while to play again if sync in is unplugged and then reconnected after a while (need some sort of cutoff)
- Time error goes very negative after sync in unplugged for a while
- First beat or so always a bit messy in either int or ext mode, sort it out
