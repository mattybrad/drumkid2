TODO:
- Rewrite LED/GPIO pulse system, which currently runs out of alarms when there are a lot of notes
- Make error text flash
- New chance algorithm
- Magnet
- Cluster
- Swing
- Step resets to zero on stop (int sync?)
- Step doesn't keep incrementing in ext sync mode when stopped
- Turn off random hits in edit modes
- Live edit different display
- Drop rand
- Drop sync
- Tap tempo should average several taps
- Tap tempo / external tempo display should use floats and display a decimal point
- Debounce button pushes
- Tidy up groups feature
- Figure out behaviour if desired output pulse length is too long for PPQN value at given tempo
- First DAC cycle after start button press is v slow (10ms+, should be 5ms max), no idea why
- DisplayPulse is scheduled, which means it can override other display functions - needs to be cancellable
- Double hits in live edit mode (direct hit followed by scheduled hit)
