TODO:

- Tap tempo should average several taps
- Tap tempo / external tempo display should use floats and display a decimal point
- Debounce button pushes
- Tidy up groups feature
- Allow different sample rates when loading WAV files
- Allow stereo WAV files (but bounce to mono)
- Figure out behaviour if desired output pulse length is too long for PPQN value at given tempo
- First DAC cycle after start button press is v slow (10ms+, should be 5ms max), no idea why
- DisplayPulse is scheduled, which means it can override other display functions - needs to be cancellable
