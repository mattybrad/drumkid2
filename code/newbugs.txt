TODO:
- Relaxed pass through the code to add comments while still fresh in head
- Leave room around screw heads on back of top PCB, prevent shorts
- Choose knobs / rotate pots 90 degs in PCB 2.04

FUTURE STUFF:
- Some weirdness still when switching from ext to int, perhaps because of using >1 PPQN (uses beats 2,3,4,5 rather than 1,2,3,4!)
- Manual needs images
- Rename "other" to "tom" or "click" or something, or rename all channels CH1, CH2, etc
- Allow swung clock output
- implement groups feature in edit modes
- Power down detection (voltage divider from 12V supply to GPIO pin with interrupt ideally, 470uF+ capacitor(s) on the 5V supply)
- Tempo display should average several pulses in ext mode
- Swing and live edit don't play nicely (the maths will be horrible)
- Tapping should be allowed to start on beat other than first beat
- Somehow avoid double hits when doing tap tempo (similar to live edit..?)
- Pressing "X" after selecting beat/tempo/tuplet etc should revert to previous setting for that param (niche but logical)
- Try incrementing settings writes onto next page, not next sector
- Try Pico 2, should be better
- Swing zoom cutout is optional in settings
- Scrolling text for longer settings labels
- Seed the rand function
- More beats, plus empty ones for users
- Soft reset?
- Extra protection ("no") for factory reset
- Move some stuff to second core, maybe events, maybe hit calculation
- Dotted notes in tuplet mode?
- Manual save vs auto save, setting
- Backup to SD
