BUGS TO FIX
- Slide is disabled
- Sync in is disabled (and bad)
- Sync out doesn't always trigger on first beat (when hitting play)
- No SD card causes crash on boot

FEATURES TO ADD
- Beat programming
    - 
- Better LED display messages, not just numbers
- Better pitch lerping (not correct in reverse..?)
- Prioritise more recent(?) notes in reverse to give expected sound at higher zooms
- Try separate drop control for random hits
- Numeric input
- Non-integer tempos, or at least higher precision
- Dead zone around pitch = 1.0
- "Debouncing"(?) on drop pot, don't allow noisy liminal modes
- Finalise swing implementation, see notes
