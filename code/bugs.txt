BUGS TO FIX
- Slide is disabled
- No SD card causes crash on boot

FEATURES TO ADD
- Figure out tempo adjustment again and int/ext timing behaviour
- Restore tuplet/swing
- Subtractive velocity (vel knob is zero in middle, -100% on left, +100% on right, possible setting to turn off all/random velocities except 0%/100%)
- Save PPQN value to flash
- Finalise expected folder format
- Backup beats to SD
- Tap tempo
- Better pitch lerping (not correct in reverse..?)
- Prioritise more recent(?) notes in reverse to give expected sound at higher zooms
- Try separate drop control for random hits
- Numeric input
- Non-integer tempos, or at least higher precision
- Dead zone around pitch = 1.0
- "Debouncing"(?) on drop pot, stays in current mode until definite change
- Finalise swing implementation, see notes
- Randomise everything button
- Tuned (V/8ve) additive tempo CV input
