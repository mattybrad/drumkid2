BUGS TO FIX
- HZQD no longer stable at 500BPM+
- Live beat input is not great, can't really do tuplets, kinda unreliable
- Rogue random hits with chance=0 and magnet>0 with time signatures>4?
- Output settings get reset when loading new kit

FEATURES TO ADD
- Figure out exactly when to save settings
- Live input undo?
- Separate trigger pulse length setting
- Program selection of default beats
- Finalise default kit and three(?) other kits for beta testers
- Dedicated back button?
- "Clear" moves to shift+X or hold X etc
- Pitch deadzone setting working
- Live input quantize setting working
POST-BETA FEATURES (non-essential)
- Reinitializing flash seems to leave vestige of old samples
- "Debouncing"(?) on drop pot, stays in current mode until definite change
- Fractional tempos (e.g. 120.1BPM)
- Allow stereo samples (load as mono)
- Allow other sample rates
- Backup beats to SD
- Better pitch lerping (not correct in reverse..?)
- Prioritise more recent(?) notes in reverse to give expected sound at higher zooms
- Use true midpoint of bizarrely asymmetrical pots! Like 1900/2000 rather than 2048?
