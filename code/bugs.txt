BUGS TO FIX
- HZQD no longer stable at 500BPM+

FEATURES TO ADD
- Direct beat input
- Quick preset/pad buttons (A B C D?)
- Confirm save slot before finally saving
- Program selection of default beats
- Finalise default kit and three(?) other kits for beta testers
- Check total sample size, error if too large
- Allow stereo samples (load as mono)
- Finalise expected folder format
- Add LEDs (pulse and external clock for now)
- Save PPQN value to flash
- Backup beats to SD
- Better pitch lerping (not correct in reverse..?)
- Prioritise more recent(?) notes in reverse to give expected sound at higher zooms
- Numeric input
- "Debouncing"(?) on drop pot, stays in current mode until definite change
- Randomise everything button
- List sample sets in alphabetical order
- Revert beat (store flash beat in RAM then restore when changing beat)
- Cool bootup visuals
- Output pulse length setting (sync/trigger)
- Use true midpoint of bizarrely asymmetrical pots! Like 1900/2000 rather than 2048?

POST-BETA FEATURES (non-essential)
- Fractional tempos (e.g. 120.1BPM)
