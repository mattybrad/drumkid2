BUGS TO FIX
- HZQD no longer stable at 500BPM+
- Live beat input is not great, can't really do tuplets, kinda unreliable
- Rogue random hits with chance=0 and magnet>0 with time signatures>4?

FEATURES TO ADD
- Crop
- Live input undo?
- Program selection of default beats
- Finalise default kit and three(?) other kits for beta testers
- Dedicated back button?
- Same pulse lengths for all LEDs
- Niche settings menu
    - Output pulse length setting (sync/trigger)
    - Live input quantize
    - Move PPQN settings here
    - Save niche settings to flash
    - Bootup visuals on/off
    - Pitch deadzone disable
    - Glitch channel (both, 1, 2, none)
POST-BETA FEATURES (non-essential)
- "Debouncing"(?) on drop pot, stays in current mode until definite change
- Fractional tempos (e.g. 120.1BPM)
- Allow stereo samples (load as mono)
- Backup beats to SD
- Better pitch lerping (not correct in reverse..?)
- Prioritise more recent(?) notes in reverse to give expected sound at higher zooms
- Use true midpoint of bizarrely asymmetrical pots! Like 1900/2000 rather than 2048?
- Randomise everything button (maybe not compatible with dedicated knobs? or would have to rewrite the whole knob system)
