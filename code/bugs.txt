BUGS TO FIX
- HZQD no longer stable at 500BPM+
- Slide is disabled
- No SD card causes crash on boot

FEATURES TO ADD
- Confirm save slot before finally saving
- Pitch should be normal at 50%
- Adjust chance implementation so large subdivisions (quarter note, 8th note) are more likely than smaller ones (more musical)
- Program selection of default beats
- Finalise default kit and three(?) other kits for beta testers
- "Drop" should be neutral/full at 50%, probably with dead zone (could just duplicate the full setting a few times)
- Check total sample size, error if too large
- Allow stereo samples (load as mono)
- Finalise expected folder format
- Add LEDs (pulse and external clock for now)
- Save PPQN value to flash
- Backup beats to SD
- Better pitch lerping (not correct in reverse..?)
- Prioritise more recent(?) notes in reverse to give expected sound at higher zooms
- Numeric input
- Dead zone around pitch = 1.0
- "Debouncing"(?) on drop pot, stays in current mode until definite change
- Randomise everything button
- List sample sets in alphabetical order
- Revert beat
- Cool bootup visuals

POST-BETA FEATURES (non-essential)
- Fractional tempos (e.g. 120.1BPM)
