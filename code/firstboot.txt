What happens on first boot?
Factory reset should do same

Flash memory is random/blank and must be initialised
SD card might not be present
Generate temporary/default samples
Generate default beats

Also think about:
What happens when firmware is first loaded
What happens when new firmware is loaded
Backing up settings to SD

BUILDING A NEW DK2:
Solder everything
Connect USB (not debug)
Drag n drop HEX file (or UF2 or whatever)
If SD card has default kit, load it
Else do white noise blips (or default kit at some point in future)
