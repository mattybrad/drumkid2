Most hardware stuff seems to be working now at least in theory. SD card works in MicroPython but not yet C++, LED display is a bit flickery but I think that's a code timing issue. Next step is a full test program which does the following:
- Loads WAV files from SD card
- Pressing buttons displays button number
- Holding button shows relevant pot/CV value
- Start/stop works
- Sync out works
- Trigger outs work
- Sync in flashes LED

Steps before this is possible:
- Test program to run LED display without flicker
- Test program to read/write SD card
