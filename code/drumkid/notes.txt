Most hardware stuff seems to be working now at least in theory. SD card works in MicroPython but not yet C++, LED display is a bit flickery but I think that's a code timing issue. Next step is a full test program which does the following:
- Loads WAV files from SD card
- Pressing buttons displays button number
- Holding button shows relevant pot/CV value
- Start/stop works
- Sync out works
- Trigger outs work
- Sync in flashes LED

Thing I just thought of that is probably quite annoying: the characteristic sound of Drumkid is reliant on modulating the velocity of the hits, but this won't really be possible for the trigger outputs. Maybe it's okay. Or maybe the next version needs envelope outputs. Or velocity outputs plus triggers, but that's a lot of sockets.
